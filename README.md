# Spatial Data in R
workshop notes for working with spatial data in R
SEI R-users group 6-29-2016

## Goals 
Go over some common workflows relevant to members of the group. In particular...
* Getting Data in -- importing data from common GIS formats `.shp` and `.tif`
* Basic manipulations -- projecting, extracting, cropping, overlay
* Visualizing it -- some tips and tricks for interacting with data
* A (slightly more advanced) discussion of interpolation and cross validation

## Resources
* lets try using [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/), a tool for collaborative note-taking, during the presentation. Click on the link [here]( insert_url ), to post comments, notes, and questions throughout the session. The resulting document will be posted permanently for future reference.
* Data used for the examples are hosted in this repository. The zipped file contains the following:
    - `dem.tif` : an elevation raster for Hawaii
    - `stations.shp`: a shapefile of climate stations (as points) with monthly rainfall
    - `counties.shp`: a shapefile of polygons with level x watersheds.
